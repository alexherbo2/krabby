Krabby is an open source browser extension (for [Chrome], [Firefox] and [surf]) used for keyboard-based navigation, inspired by [Kakoune].

The main differences with [existing extensions](docs/alternatives.md) are:
multiple selections,
keyboard layout agnostic,
SOV ([subject–object–verb]) constructs and
simple interaction with external programs.
It is also quite usable with the mouse.

## TL;DR

**WebExtension** — **Keyboard interface** — **Subject–object–verb order** — **Multiple selections** — **Kakoune-inspired**

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/alexherbo2/krabby
cd krabby
make install [static=no] [extensions=yes] [interactive=yes]
```

After installing, try to accomplish the following examples:

<details>

<summary>Opening links in a paragraph</summary>

Navigate to <https://tuppervim.org> and type:

```
f{hint}s[alt+a][alt+I][ctrl+enter][alt+x]
```

**Explanation**

- <kbd>f</kbd> enters hint mode,
- `{hint}` is a placeholder for you to select a link,
- <kbd>s</kbd> creates a selection out of the active element,
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>a</kbd> expands the region,
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> selects all links,
- <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> opens selected links in the background.
- Optionally, <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>x</kbd> will undo the operation (closing right tabs).

</details>

<details>

<summary>Play videos with mpv</summary>

Navigate to <https://youtube.com/results?search_query=Berserk+AMV> and type:

```
F{hint}{hint}<page-down>{hint}<escape>m
```

**Explanation**

- <kbd>F</kbd> enters hint mode (lock),
- `{hint}` is a placeholder for you to select 2 links,
- <kbd>Page Down</kbd> scrolls one page down,
- `{hint}` is a placeholder for you to select another link,
- <kbd>Escape</kbd> leaves hint mode.
- Finally, <kbd>m</kbd> opens the selection with [mpv].

</details>

## Features

- [Subject–object–verb] order.  Learn more at [Differences with Vi(m)][A linguistic twist].
- Keyboard layout agnostic.  Maps to physical keys, but displays with the [US layout][QWERTY].
- Multiple selections as a central way of interacting
- Powerful selection manipulation primitives
- Link hints
- External editor support.  Open your favorite editor on text inputs.
- Tab search
- Contextual commands
- Contextual help
- Simple interaction with external programs
- Usable with the mouse.  You can for example create a selection by grabbing a
link with the mouse and <kbd>s</kbd> to create the selection.  Or create multiple
selections by clicking on hints with <kbd>F</kbd>.  If you hold <kbd>Control</kbd>
or <kbd>Command</kbd>, you can even make selections with the mouse selection area.
- Limited scope.  Krabby is not [Vim], nor [Kakoune].  Krabby is trying to be a
navigation tool and some concepts from code editors don’t translate well.  For
example, there is no concept of mode in Krabby, but a system of contexts.
- Composability.  Composability is better than extensibility.  Krabby tries hard
to provide features that interact well with each other.  For example, <kbd>f</kbd>
and <kbd>y</kbd> are two building blocks to focus a link and yank its URL.  Depending
on the context, <kbd>y</kbd> will yank the page or a link URL.
- Modular (think [Emacs]).  Krabby is divided into multiple small projects.  At
its core Krabby just holds the configuration and grabs its functionalities from
other projects.
- [Chrome], [Firefox] and [surf] support.  It has also been tested on [Opera],
[Vivaldi] and [Brave].
